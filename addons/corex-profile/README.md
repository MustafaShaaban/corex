# Corex Profile

Front-office accounts for CoreX — login, registration, forgot/reset password, profile
editing, notifications, and active-session management — layered over WordPress
authentication and kept separate from `wp-admin`. The add-on owns the account logic; the
theme only presents it.

## What it provides

- **`corex/account` block** — an auth-aware panel. Signed out: login, registration
  (gated by the site's *Membership → Anyone can register* setting), and a forgot-password
  form. Signed in: profile editing, active sessions, and recent account activity. Placed
  by the **Account** page template (`page-account`).
- **`corex/v1/account/*` REST routes** — `login`, `register`, `reset-request`, `reset`
  (public auth endpoints), and `profile`, `sessions`, `sessions/revoke-others`,
  `sessions/revoke-all`, `notifications` (require a signed-in user + REST nonce).
- **`account.js`** — posts each form to its REST route and writes the answer in that
  form's own message line, under its button (`.corex-account__status`, a polite status),
  bringing the line into the window when it is outside it. A request that does not arrive,
  or is answered with something that is not JSON, or is refused with no message, is said
  in that line too, in one sentence the server hands the script
  (`corexAccount.i18n.noAnswer`).
- **With scripting off** the block shows a note above its forms
  (`<noscript><p class="corex-account__noscript">`) saying that they need JavaScript. A
  form sent anyway goes to the page's own address, which does not answer it: the forms do
  not work without scripts. The note names no other place to sign in, because WordPress's
  own address is the hidden one on a site with login protection on.

## Architecture

| Layer | Class | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Orchestration | `Account\AccountService` | Validation + policy (registration gate, password rules, enumeration-safe reset). Pure; unit-tested with a fake gateway. |
| Boundary | `Account\WordPressAuthGateway` | Every WordPress auth call (`wp_signon`, `wp_insert_user`, `retrieve_password`, the reset flow, `wp_update_user`). Never reimplements hashing. |
| Sessions | `Session\SessionService` + `Session\SessionList` | Lists a user's sessions (pure formatter, no token leak) and ends other/all sessions via core helpers. |
| Notifications | `Notification\NotificationService` | The signed-in user's own activity, projected from the shared core activity stream. |
| Presentation | `Block\AccountRenderer` | Pure, fully escaped HTML for the block. |

Every account operation returns a typed `Account\AccountResult` — no caller infers success
from a void call. Passwords, reset keys, and session tokens never appear in a result.

## Security

- Registration is honeypot- and captcha-gated (when Corex Captcha is active) and respects
  the site registration setting.
- A username WordPress would store as a different one (`CORP\salma` as `CORPsalma`) is
  refused with the code `invalid_username`, by WordPress's own `validate_username()`. With
  no username the login is made from the email address and the person signs in with the
  address.
- Login delegates to `wp_signon`, inheriting core's auth filters and any login hardening.
- Password reset responses are generic, so the endpoint cannot enumerate accounts.
- Authenticated routes require a signed-in user and the REST nonce; the service also
  confirms a user only ever edits their own profile or sessions.
- Recovery keeps working even when login is hardened (front-office is separate from
  `wp-admin`).

## Testing

- Unit: `tests/Unit/Profile/` — `AccountServiceTest`, `SessionListTest`,
  `NotificationListTest`, `AccountRendererTest`.
- Script: `tests/corex-account.test.js` (Jest) — where an answer is written, that one is on
  the page at a time, how the line is brought into view, and what is said when a request
  gets no answer the script can read.
- Browser: `tests/e2e/product-surfaces.spec.js` — the message is inside the window, under
  its button and as wide as the fields, on a desktop and a phone, in both directions; a
  sign-in whose request is aborted, or answered with an error page, says so in its form;
  with scripting off the note is above the forms and inside the window.
- Integration: `tests/Integration/Profile/ProfileLifecycleTest.php` — the real lifecycle
  on WordPress (register → duplicate guard → credential validity → profile edit → reset →
  sessions; plus the registration-disabled gate).
  `tests/Integration/Profile/RegistrationUsernameTest.php` — which usernames the register
  route refuses and which it keeps. `tests/Integration/Profile/ProfileNamesKeepBackslashesTest.php`
  — a profile's names are saved as written.
